# Discord_Image_bot
Allows user to use discord as an image server. User uploads images to a directory, and bot uploads it to discord.
User can assign images to specific channels/folders within discord with reactions. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Add a "Pictures" folder to in the same directory as the bot
2. Add .ENV File to in the same directory as the bot, with your bots token id
3. Change channels to your needs. Channels in the code are my particular use case.
